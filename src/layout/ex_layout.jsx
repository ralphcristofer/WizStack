 * Layouts are typically used to formulate the ideal look and feel of an application,
 * by pulling together common components into a hierarchy. 
 * 
 * For example:
 * <NavBar />
 * <SideBar />
 * <Content />
 * <Footer />
 * 
 * The layout folder is used to store all the layouts of the application. Please use it as such.
